# Mall Customer Segmentation

This project focuses on segmenting mall customers based on their purchasing behavior using clustering techniques. The goal is to group customers with similar characteristics to better understand customer patterns.

The dataset contains customer information such as age, annual income, and spending score. After data exploration and preprocessing, clustering is applied to identify meaningful customer groups.

Python and Jupyter Notebook are used for implementation along with data analysis and visualization libraries. The results help in identifying different types of customers such as high spenders, low spenders, and average customers.

This project can be applied in marketing strategy, customer targeting, business planning, and retail analytics.
